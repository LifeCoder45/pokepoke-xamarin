# Welcome to MegaAmp!

## What is it?

It's a vibration detection and amplification widget that pushes local notifcations - these will trickle to your paired wearable as well.

## How do I build it?

1. Put your Android device in Developer Mode (probably tap Build Number in settings ~7 times)
2. Enable USB Debugging in Developer Options
3. Install [Xamarin Studio](https://www.xamarin.com/) on Mac or Windows
4. Clone this repo
5. Open PokePoke.sln in Xamarin Studio (Mac) or Visual Studio 2015 (Windows)
6. Build > Rebuild all to restore Nuget dependencies
7. Attach device, hit run
8. Done!

## Why is it here / What's with "PokéXYZ"?

It was originally a Pokémon detection app for Pokémon GO, but it was Suspended on the Play Store, so here it is again, generic style.

Originally [here on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4taed4/i_skipped_sleep_and_countless_pidgeys_this_week/).

If you want to buy the new app, you can on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.joshoneal.megaamp).

Enjoy!
